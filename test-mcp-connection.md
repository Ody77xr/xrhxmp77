# MCP Server Connection Test

## After Restarting Kiro

### How to Verify MCP Servers are Running

1. **Open Kiro Command Palette**
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac)
   - Type "MCP" to see MCP-related commands

2. **Check MCP Server View**
   - Look for the "MCP Servers" panel in Kiro
   - You should see:
     - ✅ supabase (running)
     - ✅ netlify (running)

3. **Test Supabase Connection**
   - Ask me: "List all tables in Supabase"
   - Or: "Show me the Supabase project info"
   - I should be able to access your database

4. **Test Netlify Connection**
   - Ask me: "List my Netlify sites"
   - Or: "Show Netlify deployment status"
   - I should be able to access your Netlify account

## If MCP Servers Don't Start

### Troubleshooting Steps

1. **Check if `uv` is installed**
   ```bash
   uv --version
   ```
   If not installed, install it:
   - Windows: `pip install uv` or use installer from https://docs.astral.sh/uv/
   - Mac: `brew install uv` or `pip install uv`

2. **Manually test MCP server**
   ```bash
   uvx mcp-server-supabase
   ```

3. **Check MCP configuration**
   - Open `.kiro/settings/mcp.json`
   - Verify the configuration is correct

4. **Restart Kiro again**
   - Sometimes a second restart helps

## Expected Behavior After Restart

✅ You should see MCP servers in the Kiro sidebar
✅ I will have access to Supabase tools
✅ I will have access to Netlify tools
✅ We can start creating database schemas
✅ We can deploy to Netlify directly

## Ready to Continue?

Once MCP servers are running, tell me:
"MCP servers are running, let's design the database schema"

Then we'll:
1. Design comprehensive database schema
2. Create all necessary tables
3. Set up relationships and policies
4. Implement authentication
5. Build out all features
6. Deploy to production

**Note:** The MCP servers run in the background and give me superpowers to interact with Supabase and Netlify directly!
